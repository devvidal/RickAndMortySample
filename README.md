# Rick and Morty Characters App Documentation

## üìÑ Overview
This application is inspired by the **Rick and Morty** series and allows users to **browse characters** and **view detailed information** about each one. It features smooth **animations** to enhance user experience and a clean, reactive interface.

All character data is fetched from an **open GraphQL API** using the **Apollo** client library.

The app is built using the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architecture and follows **SOLID principles** and **Clean Code** practices for scalability and maintainability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Apollo GraphQL**  
  Used to fetch data from the Rick and Morty API via GraphQL.

- **Hilt**  
  Used for dependency injection to promote modular, testable code.

- **Jetpack Compose**  
  Used to build a modern, declarative UI with animation support.

- **Kotlin Flow & Coroutines**  
  Used for asynchronous data handling and reactive state management.

- **Room**  
  Used for local data persistence.

## üéØ Architecture Highlights

- MVVM pattern separates concerns between UI, business logic, and data handling.
- SOLID principles and Clean Code ensure long-term project sustainability.
- Uses animations and Compose transitions to improve UX.
- Fully reactive data flow with Flow, Coroutines, and Jetpack Compose.
